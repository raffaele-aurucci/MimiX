# Mimix

Every day, millions of people with facial muscle degeneration see their ability to move gradually decline. Rehabilitation is essential, but itâ€™s often boring and hard to follow consistently.  

The problem? Without regular exercise, the degeneration progresses more rapidly. And when exercises are repetitive and unengaging, itâ€™s easy to give up.  

Thatâ€™s why we created **Mimix**: an innovative **Digital Therapeutics app** that turns therapy into a game! Using **AI-powered facial expression recognition**, our app offers targeted exercises through interactive mini-games, helping users slow down the loss of facial mobility in a fun and effective way.  

The experience is enhanced with **Gamification techniques**: increasing levels of challenge, tasks to complete, milestones to reach, and rewards to win-making the process engaging and motivating.

***With Mimix, we want to help people preserve their facial expressionsâ€¦ one smile at a time!*** ðŸ˜Š

## Architecture
Mimix is designed as a standalone application. We use ```Flutter``` for both the frontend and backend, except for AI model computation, which is handled using ```HTML5```, ```CSS```, and ```JavaScript``` executed through a local server embedded through a WebView. This WebView handles the processing and accesses the device's camera to display the user's face in real-time.  
The AI models used are part of the Face Landmarks package from ```MediaPipe```, which includes a Face Detector, a Face Mesh, and a Face Blendshape for real-time facial analysis and expression recognition.  
For persistent data storage, we utilize ```SQLite```, ensuring efficient and reliable local data management. Finally, we leverage the ```Flame``` game engine, which is optimized for 2D development and seamlessly integrates with Flutter, providing a performant and smooth gaming experience.
