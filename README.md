# MÃ¬mix

Every day, millions of people with facial muscle degeneration see their ability to move gradually decline. Rehabilitation is essential, but itâ€™s often boring and hard to follow consistently.  

The problem? Without regular exercise, the degeneration progresses more rapidly. And when exercises are repetitive and unengaging, itâ€™s easy to give up.  

Thatâ€™s why we created **MÃ¬miX**: an innovative **Digital Therapeutics app** that turns therapy into a game! Using **AI-powered Facial Expression Detection**, our app offers targeted exercises through interactive mini-games, helping users slow down the loss of facial mobility in a fun and effective way.  

The experience is enhanced with **Gamification techniques**: increasing levels of challenge, tasks to complete, milestones to reach, and rewards to win-making the process engaging and motivating.

***"With MÃ¬miX, we want to help people preserve their facial expressionsâ€¦ one smile at a time!"*** ðŸ˜Š

## Architecture
MÃ¬miX is designed as a standalone application. We use ```Flutter``` for both the frontend and backend, except for AI model computation, which is handled using ```HTML5```, ```CSS```, and ```JavaScript``` executed through a local server embedded through a WebView. This WebView handles the processing and accesses the device's camera to display the user's face in real-time.  
The AI models used are part of the Face Landmarks package from ```MediaPipe```, which includes a Face Detector, a Face Mesh, and a Face Blendshape for real-time facial analysis and expression recognition.  
For persistent data storage, we utilize ```SQLite```, ensuring efficient and reliable local data management. Finally, we leverage the ```Flame``` game engine, which is optimized for 2D development and seamlessly integrates with Flutter, providing a performant and smooth gaming experience.

## Repository Contents
The repository is structured as follows:  
- ```android/```: Contains all configuration files for Android, such as permissions, splash screen, etc.  
- ```ios/```: Similar to the Android directory (additional adjustments might be necessary).  
- ```assets/```: Includes all assets used by the app, such as images, GIFs, fonts, etc.  
- ```lib/```: The core of the system, containing all the app's subsystems.  
- ```web_project/```: Contains files executed on localhost, including an HTML page that accesses the device's camera and a TypeScript file for running inference with MediaPipe AI models.  
- ```pubspec.yaml```: Essential configuration file for the Flutter project.

## Installation Guide

### Flutter project
To correctly execute the project, follow the installation guide for ```Flutter``` at this [link](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install): choose your preferred development environment and target device. We recommend Android as the target environment.  

Use Flutter SDK version **>=3.5.3** and **<=3.6.0** to avoid dependency issues.  

Next, run the following command in your terminal from root of project:  

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Web project
Optionally, if you need to edit the files executed within the ```web_project``` directory, install ```NodeJS``` from this [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current).  

The only files that should be modified are:  
- ```index.html```  
- ```index.ts```  
- ```style.ts```  

After installing NodeJS, run the following commands installing all required dependencies:  

```bash
npm install
```

Starts the local development server.
```bash
npm run start
```

Builds the project to be deployed in the WebView.
```bash
npm run build
```

Insert the build in folder ```assets/``` overwriting the ```camera/``` folder (old build).
